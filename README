Basic full-stack JavaScript app template

To build: npm run build

To start the server: npm run start

To start in dev mode, with everything watched: npm run watch

TODO: Use makefiles to cut down on some of the work (eg 'npm run start'
currently runs 'npm run build' unconditionally).

The intention of this template is that you, the author of your app,
should claim it as your own. Change all the URLs and authorship marks in
package.json to be your own :)
